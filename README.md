Crafting your own nutritious meal has never been made so easy with this React based app that allows users to create and visualize their next meal. Whether youâ€™re up to healthy rice and salad bowls or a divinely crafted bowl of oats, you decide what your next meal looks like.

This project is currently in development. Users can progress through a series of steps to customize a bowl from its base ingredients to the final drizzles and dashes of flavor.

**Main features:**

**1)** Single page React app that contains main functionality<br/>
**2)** Interaction with Axios, an HTTP client library, that allows users to make requests to a Food API for retrieving nutritional information based on precise serving size selections.
