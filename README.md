Crafting your own nutritious meal has never been made so easy with this React based app that allows
users to create and visualize their next meal. Whether youâ€™re up to healthy rice and salad bowls or a
divinely crafted bowl of oats, Build Your Bowl has a lot to offer.

This project is currently in development. Users can progress through a series of steps to customize
a bowl from its base ingredients to the final drizzles and dashes.

**Main features:
**1)** Single page React app that contains main functionality
**2)** Interaction with Axios, an HTTP client library that allows users to make requests to a Food API
for retrieving nutritional information based on precise serving size selections.
